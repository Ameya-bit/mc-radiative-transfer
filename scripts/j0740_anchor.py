"""Second real-star anchor: the beaming swap at PSR J0740+6620, where it does NOT eclipse.

v0.9.1 planted the isotropic→realistic beaming swap at PSR J0030+0451 and found the
pulsed-fraction systematic *saturated* to ΔPF ≈ 0: J0030's two spots hug the same pole,
dive behind the star, and pin PF = 1 for every beaming, so the systematic could only
show up in the waveform *shape*. The obvious question that leaves open is whether a real
star ever lets the systematic land back in the pulsed fraction. This script answers it
at the other end of the NICER mass–radius sample.

    Riley et al. (2021, ApJL 918 L27)   — X-PSI / Amsterdam, ST-U model
    Miller et al. (2021, ApJL 918 L28)  — Illinois–Maryland, two-circle

The result — and why J0740 is the complement of J0030. Riley's fit places J0740's two
hot spots in *opposite* hemispheres (colatitudes 77° and 108°) viewed almost edge-on
(i ≈ 87.6°). With its extreme compactness (u ≈ 0.494) light bending lets us see far
enough around the back that **neither spot ever sets** — each only grazes the limb
(μ_min ≈ 0.005). And because the spots are ~half a cycle apart in azimuth (Δφ ≈ 0.44),
they *tile* the rotation: when one is at the limb the other faces us, so the summed
flux never falls near zero (floor F_min/F_max ≈ 0.70). The isotropic pulsed fraction is
therefore low and far from saturation (PF ≈ 0.18), leaving ample headroom. Swapping in
the realistic beaming raises it directly: **ΔPF climbs to ≈ +0.16 at τ ≈ 10**, the same
size, sign, and τ-dependence v0.9.0 found on invented geometries — now on a published
star and *visible in the pulsed fraction itself*.

Both teams agree (the cross-check anchor). Miller's independent fit agrees with Riley on
M, R, inclination, anti-phasing, and the two-circular-spot model, but places the spots
essentially *on the equator* (colatitude ≈ 92°). There each spot's *center* does dip
behind the star for ~21% of the cycle — yet because the two spots are anti-phased, the
eclipses fall at opposite phases and the *combined* pulse still never reaches zero
(floor ≈ 0.63). So PF stays unsaturated for Miller too, and the swap lands an even larger
**ΔPF ≈ +0.23 at τ ≈ 10**. The headline is therefore robust to the choice of team: at
J0740 the beaming systematic is a +0.16…+0.23 pulsed-fraction effect either way.

The discriminator, made precise. The thing that flips J0030's verdict is *not* whether a
single spot eclipses — Miller's J0740 spots eclipse 21% each and still leave a live ΔPF.
It is whether the two spots **tile** the rotation. J0030's spots hug the *same* far
hemisphere and each is hidden ~45% of the cycle, so even anti-phased their visible
windows leave a dark gap: the summed flux touches zero, PF pins at 1, ΔPF ≈ 0, and the
systematic retreats into waveform shape. J0740's spots sit in opposite regions and are
shallow enough that anti-phasing fully covers the cycle: the pulse stays off zero, PF
keeps its headroom, and the systematic shows up where NICER reads it — in the pulsed
fraction. PF-visible at J0740, shape-only at J0030: tiling is the knob.

Built with no change to the verified ``mcrt.pulse`` core: each spot is a
:func:`mcrt.compute_profile` call, a spot at a different longitude is that profile
rolled in phase, and light is additive — all via :mod:`anchor_lib`, shared with the
J0030 script so the two cannot drift apart.
