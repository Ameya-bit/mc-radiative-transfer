# Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer

We simulate X-ray photons bouncing through the thin layer of plasma that sits on top of a
neutron star. Each photon is followed one scatter at a time until it either escapes into space
or is reabsorbed by the surface. By recording the directions of the photons that escape, we
measure the star's **beaming function** `I(μ)` — how its brightness depends on viewing angle.
That beaming function is the input NASA's NICER telescope needs to turn a pulsing X-ray signal
into a measurement of a neutron star's mass and radius. Most models assume the surface glows
equally in all directions; this project tests how wrong that assumption is.

### v0.9.11 — Exact transport validation: the isotropic engine reproduces Chandrasekhar H(μ)
*2026-07-07 · commit `<pending>`*

**The transport core stops being an unchecked assumption. Every prior validation compared the
engine to something itself approximate (the ~1% bending map, the NICER code comparisons, the
linear Eddington law). There is exactly one place a closed-form *exact* answer exists for our
geometry: a conservative semi-infinite atmosphere that scatters **isotropically** emits
I(μ) ∝ Chandrasekhar H(μ). Track D adds an opt-in isotropic phase function (P(μ) = 1/2, default
Thomson bit-for-bit unchanged), runs one thick slab (τ = 10, 5 seeds, 4.1×10⁵ escaped), and the
emergent distribution matches H(μ)·μ with flux-space reduced χ² = 0.70 (dof 17, max residual
1.6σ) — a clean match within Monte Carlo error. That certifies step sampling, boundaries, escape,
the ∝μ Lambertian source, and the histogram, with the phase function held fixed.**

The measurement had a trap worth recording. The naïve check — reconstruct I(μ) = counts/μ and
compare to H — *fails* (χ² = 11.7, and the Thomson control looks better than isotropic), because
dividing the per-bin flux ∫I(μ)μ dμ by the bin *center* mis-estimates I by O(Δμ²) — the
attention-fix-8b bin-center bias, a systematic that grows with statistics and drowns the signal.
The fix is to test what the MC measures directly: the raw escaping angular distribution vs
N·∫H(μ)μ dμ, no reconstruction. The **Thomson control** — same machinery, physical dipole phase
function — sits at χ² = 1.49 (2.8% max deviation): the ~1–3% phase-function sensitivity
(Chandrasekhar Ch. X). So H is a **near-exact** reference for the real atmosphere, never the exact
one — the wording guardrail the paper's transport paragraph (item 7) needs. Suite **119 green**.

then E1 number propagation → v1.0.0-rc, the paper.

### v0.9.12 — The headline survives its two cheapest attacks: the tail model and the atmosphere law
*2026-07-07 · commit `1b0a9ba`*

**Two structural worries about the beaming curve that feeds ΔPF are now measured, and neither
moves the result. First, the *grazing tail*: the library's two lowest-μ bins are its noisiest
(per-seed scatter 5.4% and 3.2%, vs ~0.6% just above μ=0.1) and the lookup clamps them flat below
μ=0.1 — an arbitrary choice. Resampling those bins within their measured σ, and replacing the flat
clamp with a physically-motivated Chandrasekhar-H-shaped tail, shifts ΔPF by ≤ 0.006, at or below
the ±0.003 seed error bar — the tail is not load-bearing. Second, the *atmosphere law*: repeating
the J0740 swap under the Eddington (1+1.5μ) and Chandrasekhar H(μ) limb-darkening laws reproduces
the same positive, spin-diluted signal (+0.13…+0.20 static, +0.03…+0.06 at 346.5 Hz), with the
magnitude tracking each law's limb-darkening slope b. The effect is a property of limb darkening,
not of the Thomson slab.**

Both are run static *and* at the real 346.5 Hz — because aberration samples the beaming at
μ' = δ cos α, reaching into the tail at faint phases, the spin-diluted number carries its own tail
sensitivity (the one place it shows: Miller at spin, |δ(ΔPF)| = 0.006, where the grazing spots let
aberration pull the tail into the min/max statistic). Both drivers reproduce the exact-bending
headline (+0.137/+0.195 static, +0.037/+0.061 at spin) as their reference case, so the perturbation
is the only thing changing. Pure interpolation + geometry, seconds each. Suite **127 green**.

**Next:** E1 — propagate the numbers and three-part routing framing through README/anchor scripts,
then Track F scope paragraphs → v1.0.0-rc, the paper.

### v0.9.10 — Doppler at the real spin: the PF systematic re-routes into waveform shape
*2026-07-07 · commit `<pending>`*

**The frozen star is retired, and what looked like the headline collapsing turned out to be
the headline moving. J0740 spins at 346.5 Hz — its spots move at β ≈ 0.127 c (Riley), and the
special-relativistic Doppler boost + aberration layer (Track C, Bogdanov et al. 2019 S+D
recipe, validated against the 200 Hz SD1c code-comparison waveform to 1.36%) cuts the
bolometric ΔPF from +0.137 ± 0.003 to +0.037 (Riley, δ⁴; 37σ — Gate G2 fires) and +0.195 →
+0.061 (Miller). The mechanism is not aberration but the δ⁴ boost itself: a ±50% flux swing,
phase-offset a quarter cycle from limb-darkening, that saturates both models' pulse extremes.
But the systematic does not vanish — it re-routes. The iso-vs-real waveform-shape difference
(RMS ≈ 0.10) and most of the fundamental-harmonic gap Δ(A1/A0) are invariant to spin, energy
band, and time-delay warp: spin pumps a large common second harmonic into both models and
degrades the min/max PF as a probe of beaming, exactly as J0030's eclipse geometry routed the
systematic into shape. Two routers — geometry and spin — one conserved ~10% waveform-level
systematic.**

Three follow-on measurements pin the numbers. **(C3, band-limited)** NICER's calibrated band
(0.3–1.5 keV) sits on the Wien tail of these soft spots (kT ≈ 0.084 keV ⇒ E/kT_obs ≈ 5–25),
where Doppler acts as an effective temperature wobble amplified exponentially — the in-band
boost exponent is ≈ 6.1 (vs the bolometric 4) — so in-band photon counting deepens the
dilution to +0.019 ± 0.002 (Riley) / +0.045 ± 0.003 (Miller), with a further ±0.01 spread
across band-edge/kT scans (`mcrt.rotating.BandSpectrum`/`band_boost`; wide-band limits
recover δ³/δ⁴ exactly). **(C4, caveat audit)** The light-travel-time warp — exactly
PF-invariant for one spot — is 2–5σ for the two-spot sums and *positive*, partially restoring
the gap: the **all-geometry rotating residuals are +0.030 (Riley) / +0.056 (Miller)** in-band
(+0.041 / +0.069 under δ⁴). Oblateness is bounded at ≤ 0.001 (AM14 first-order, 0.5σ) and
stays a caveat. **(Shape routing)** All of the above leaves the shape metrics untouched.
J0030 is unmoved throughout — rotation cannot un-eclipse a spot. Suite 111 green; ν → 0
reproduces the frozen pipeline bit-for-bit.

### v0.9.9.1 — Exact Schwarzschild bending, enacted: the ~1% approximation was 2σ
*2026-07-07 · commit `<pending>`*

**The light-bending approximation is retired at the anchors, and it mattered. Every result to
date used Beloborodov's (2002) *linear* map cos α = u + (1 − u) cos ψ, "exact to ~1%" — but worst
at grazing emission, which is exactly where J0740's faint phase (μ_min ≈ 0.005, u = 0.494) sets
the pulsed fraction. B1 built the exact Schwarzschild ray integral (`ExactBending`) and validated
it (the independent SD1a code-comparison residual fell 0.80% → 0.11%). B2 now measures the cost on
the production 5-seed library and Gate G1 rules: at Riley (u = 0.494) the exact map pulls
ΔPF(τ = 10) from +0.144 ± 0.003 to +0.137 ± 0.003 — a −0.0066 shift, 2.1σ, a fixed modeling bias
that extra photons cannot remove (the ± σ is seed noise; the shift is not). Miller (u = 0.444):
+0.201 → +0.195 (1.1σ). Same sign, size, and geometry-routing — a tightening, not a reversal — so
this converts the referee's sharpest attack ("your bending is ~1% accurate right where your faint
phase lives") into a table row. J0030 stays saturated (ΔPF ≡ 0) under either map.**

The shift is resolution-stable to five decimals (n_alpha 2048 → 16384) and vanishes in the flat
limit, so it is physics, not tabulation. A second, qualitative correction falls out: the linear map
extrapolates *past the true grazing horizon* — claiming a Riley spot stays visible to ψ = 167° when
the exact horizon is 150.6° — so the v0.9.2 "neither J0740 spot ever sets" was a linear artifact.
Under exact bending each Riley spot eclipses ≈ 14% of the cycle, yet the anti-phased pair still
*tiles* (combined flux floor 0.70), PF stays unsaturated, ΔPF stays live. Even the "never-sets" star
turns out to eclipse and still tiles — the paper's **tiling-not-eclipse** discriminator only sharpens.
The switch is **enacted in the pipeline**: `j0740_anchor.py` and the phase-diagram star markers build
`ExactBending(u)` per anchor; the broad phase-diagram heatmap stays linear (stated tolerance ≤ 0.007);
`a3_seed_errors.py` stays linear as the convergence-study cross-check. **+0.137 is the 0 Hz baseline** —
the Doppler/aberration layer (Track C, Gate G2) stacks on top additively. Full suite 82 green;
the linear headline reproduces bit-for-bit.

baseline; then Track D (isotropic-scattering H(μ) transport validation) before v1.0.0 — the paper.

### v0.9.7.2 — Downstream re-runs: the headline gets its error bar
*2026-07-07 · commit `3b1fc93`*

**Every downstream result is re-run off the production library, per seed, so the paper's headline
is finally quoted as ΔPF ± σ. Pushing each of the five per-seed I(μ; τ) curves through the same
verified anchor pipeline turns the seed-to-seed spread into a Monte Carlo error bar in the currency
of the claim: at J0740, ΔPF(τ = 10) = +0.144 ± 0.003 (Riley) and +0.201 ± 0.005 (Miller) — 1.2σ
from the v0.9.7 converged +0.1486, PASS. This retires the old +0.16 / +0.23 point estimates: those
were ~1σ-high single realizations, not the converged systematic. J0030 stays saturated (shape-RMS
~6%, PF pinned); the finite-cap bound and the phase diagram re-run clean, every verdict unchanged.**

The driver (`scripts/a3_seed_errors.py`) reuses the `j0740`/`j0030` `sweep_anchor` functions
unchanged — a single seed's `intensity_by_tau_seed[:, si, :]` slice already has the (n_tau, n_bins)
shape the anchors expect — so the pooled curve gives the central value and the five seeds give σ,
with no new geometry code. The ± σ is seed noise (∝ 1/√N): it shrinks with more photons, but the
sign and size of ΔPF do not. This is the number the paper cites (later bending-corrected to
+0.137 / +0.195 at v0.9.9.1, a separate ~2σ systematic).

![J0740 two-spot pulse and ΔPF(τ) — the non-eclipsing anchor whose headline the production library fixes at +0.144 ± 0.003, with the ΔPF-vs-background robustness panel](data/pulse_profile_j0740.png)

📐 **Full derivation:** [v0.9.7.2 — Downstream Re-runs off the Production Library](docs/deep-dives/v0.9.7.2-downstream-rerun.md)

**Next:** Track B — exact Schwarzschild bending, to test whether the linear light-bending
approximation biases this headline beyond its own error bar (it does: v0.9.9 / v0.9.9.1).

### v0.9.7.1 — The production beaming library: escape-matched, 5-seed, error-barred
*2026-07-07 · commit `663612d`*

**The library every downstream number rests on is rebuilt to the v0.9.7 prescription. In place of
a flat 200k injected photons per τ on one sequential RNG, an escape-matched budget targets 4×10⁵
*escaped* photons at every τ across five independent seeds (≈ 79.3M injected total), storing per-bin
seed σ and b(τ) ± σ. The rebuild vindicates the redo: escape fraction falls 92% → 4.2% from τ = 0.1
to 30 (which is why uniform injection had been hiding a ~22× statistics disparity), and b(τ) rises
monotonically through τ = 3 and then plateaus — 1.790 ± 0.035 at τ = 10 vs 1.809 ± 0.040 at τ = 30,
flat within error — confirming the old τ = 30 dip was noise and τ = 10 ≡ τ = 30. `SHAPE_TAU = 10`
now sits on a measured plateau, not a "peak."**

`tau_sweep.py` was reworked into a process-parallel builder with per-(τ, seed) `SeedSequence`
streams — killing the sequential RNG that coupled rows — running 71.9 min wall on 16 workers. Two
bias fixes were folded in while the file was open: I(μ) normalized by the fitted slope `a` (not the
single μ ≈ 0.975 bin, fix 8a), and each bin divided by its *mean escaped* μ rather than the bin
center (unbiasing the low-μ tail, fix 8b). `beaming_library.npz` stores the pooled `intensity_by_tau`,
per-bin seed std, `b_of_tau` ± σ, all five per-seed curves (the error bars downstream needs),
escape fractions, and provenance metadata.

![Limb-darkening slope b(τ) with per-seed error bars — rising monotonically to a plateau near 1.8, with the τ = 30 dip resolved as noise](data/beaming_slope_vs_tau.png)

📐 **Full derivation:** [v0.9.7.1 — The Production Beaming Library](docs/deep-dives/v0.9.7.1-production-library.md)

**Next:** downstream re-runs off this library to quote every result as ΔPF ± σ (v0.9.7.2).

### v0.9.7 — The convergence redo: escaped photons are the currency
*2026-07-06 · commit `<pending>`*

**The library's 200k-photons-per-τ setting is replaced by a measured, per-τ photon budget —
and the paper's headline systematic survives full statistical scrutiny. The v0.7.0 study had
validated 200k for one observable at one τ; re-running convergence at every library τ, with
ΔPF itself as a tracked observable, shows the real statistical currency is *escaped* photons
(escape fraction falls 92% → 4.2% from τ = 0.1 to 30, so "uniform" 200k injected hid a 22×
statistics disparity). Three verdicts: the library's b(τ) dip at τ = 30 was noise — b(τ)
rises monotonically to a plateau (1.774 ± 0.053 at τ = 10 vs 1.756 ± 0.079 at τ = 30), so
`SHAPE_TAU = 10`'s "peak" justification must be reworded; ΔPF converges to +0.1486 ± 0.0026
(Riley J0740, τ = 10) — ~50σ above seed scatter, emphatically not Monte Carlo noise, though
the current +0.16 sits ~1σ high and should settle near +0.15 after the re-run; and low-N
ΔPF is *biased high* (converges from above), a bias error bars alone would never reveal.**

The sweep: 370 runs, 77.6M photons, all six τ, 10 seeds at small N, per-task `SeedSequence`
streams, process-parallel on 16 workers (27.5 min wall, no engine change). Error-vs-escaped
curves collapse across τ onto the N⁻¹ᐟ² line, so one calibration converts to an injected
budget per τ. Production recommendation: **4×10⁵ escaped photons per (τ, seed) × 5 seeds**
(≈ 80M injected total, ~43–120× current statistics per row), which meets every target —
σ(b) ≤ 0.02, tail bin ≤ 2%, σ(ΔPF) ≤ 0.01 pooled — and demotes tail-bin importance sampling
to future work.

📐 **Full derivation:** [v0.9.7 — The Convergence Redo](docs/deep-dives/v0.9.7-convergence-redo.md)

**Next:** the production library re-run — escape-matched `tau_sweep.py` with per-seed streams
and stored error bars, anchors re-run per seed to quote ΔPF ± σ for both J0740 fits, then
v1.0.0 — the paper.

### v0.9.6 — Finite-cap robustness: the systematic survives realistic spot size
*2026-06-30 · commit `14022da`*

**The point-spot reduction is converted from an asserted caveat into a measured bound.
Every result so far collapses each hot spot to a point at its center colatitude — least
accurate at grazing angles (μ → 0), exactly where J0740's spots skim the limb and limb
darkening bites hardest. Tiling each spot into an area-weighted finite cap and re-running
the swap shows the bias is tiny: at the published spot sizes ΔPF moves by only −0.003 (Riley
+0.164 → +0.161, Miller +0.229 → +0.226), and refining the tiling does not move it further.
J0740 stays a live, positive PF systematic; J0030 stays saturated (ΔPF ≈ 0) even at a
conservative ζ = 0.15 rad upper bound. Sign, size, and τ-shape all hold.**

The cap tiling reduces continuously to the point spot as ζ → 0, so the finite-cap curve is
continuous with the anchor results; the measured bias grows slowly and monotonically with
spot size (even an exaggerated ζ = 0.2 rad only slips Riley to +0.159). The phase-diagram
tiling/saturation *boundary* (v0.9.4) is more robust still — it is set by spot visibility,
not the cap interior, so it does not move with ζ at all. No engine change — each sub-point is
one `compute_profile` call, summed additively as in the anchors.

![Left: ΔPF vs cap radius ζ for both J0740 fits — gently declining from the point value at ζ → 0, with the published ζ marked. Right: point vs finite-cap ΔPF per anchor — J0740 nearly unchanged and live, J0030 at zero and saturated.](data/finite_cap.png)

📐 **Full derivation:** [v0.9.6 — Finite-Cap Robustness](docs/deep-dives/v0.9.6-finite-cap.md)

**Next:** v1.0.0 — the paper. The four build steps are complete: the result (v0.9.0–v0.9.2),
the phase diagram (v0.9.4), the PB06 validation + Zhao positioning (v0.9.5), and the finite-cap
bound (v0.9.6). What remains is human literature verification and writing the note.

### v0.9.5 — Validating the phase diagram, and positioning it against the closest prior work
*2026-06-30 · commit `92e37aa`*

**The map is anchored to the canonical literature and the result is placed against its
nearest neighbor. Two independent checks license the v0.9.4 extension: (1) the engine's
single-spot eclipse onset matches Beloborodov's visibility condition cos(i+θ) < −u/(1−u)
across the whole (i, θ, u) grid (0 mismatches), and (2) collapsed to the antipodal limit,
the engine reproduces the Poutanen & Beloborodov (2006) Fig. 5 visibility classes I–IV
exactly — the analytic and engine class maps are identical, all four classes present. Then
the closest prior work, Zhao, Psaltis & Özel (2024), is met head-on: on their own antipodal
geometry we add the three layers they omit — pulsed fraction, a swept azimuthal separation,
and the tiling reading.**

Reproducing the canonical map in the limit where it is established is what earns trust in
the non-antipodal, equal-colatitude slice that is the novel result. Zhao route the same
wrong-beaming systematic into inferred *radius* via the Fourier amplitude A₁/A₀, with the two
spots fixed antipodal and no tiling criterion (confirmed against both papers' full text);
pulsed fraction and azimuthal separation are exactly the axes they never use. No engine
change — every check is assembled from the verified core.

**Next:** v0.9.6 — the finite-cap robustness check (does ΔPF ≈ +0.16 survive realistic spot
size, not just point spots?), then the v1.0.0 paper.

### v0.9.4 — The geometry phase diagram: two anchors become a rule
*2026-06-30 · commit `8551023`*

**The two real-star anchors are turned into a general rule. Sweeping the geometry plane
(azimuthal spot separation Δφ × spot colatitude θ) and coloring by the beaming systematic
ΔPF = PF_real − PF_iso shows where it lands across *all* two-spot geometries — and an analytic
boundary Δφ_crit(θ) = f_ecl(θ) (the single-spot eclipse fraction) splits the plane in two:
left of it the spots' dark windows overlap, the pulse hits zero, PF saturates, and the
systematic hides in waveform shape; right of it the spots *tile* the rotation and the
systematic stays live in PF. Both J0740 fits land on the tiling side (ΔPF +0.16/+0.23); both
J0030 fits land on the saturated side (ΔPF +0.00). Tiling — not single-spot eclipse — is the
discriminator, now as a map.**

This is the paper's headline figure. The independent numerical contour where the simulated
two-spot flux floor → 0 overlays the analytic boundary almost exactly across both panels — an
internal check that the criterion is what the flux actually does. The map is a *slice* (the
background fixes both spots at equal θ, the offset-dipole/multipolar regime where the result
varies); the antipodal/centered-dipole limit is the validation case handled next, and each
real-star marker carries its true unequal-colatitude ΔPF (reproducing v0.9.1/v0.9.2 exactly).
No engine change — every cell is assembled from existing `compute_profile` calls via
`scripts/anchor_lib.py`.

![Two (Δφ, θ) panels at J0740-like and J0030-like spacetimes: ΔPF heatmap with the analytic tiling boundary and the numerical flux-floor contour overlaid; J0740 markers sit in the bright tiling region, J0030 markers in the black saturated region.](data/phase_diagram.png)

Beloborodov 2006) and position it against the closest prior work (Zhao et al. 2024), then the
finite-cap robustness check (v0.9.6) before the v1.0.0 paper.

### v0.9.3 — Research notes: direction, conventions, and J0030's geometry
*2026-06-29 · commit `bb23fd2`*

**A documentation-only milestone (no engine or result change): three pieces of background
research locked down while preparing the paper and an advisor update. (1) The project's NICER
comparison is *differential by design* — the forward simulation and NICER's inverse inference
are opposite maps, and NICER publishes multiple geometries per star, so a literal PF-to-PF
verification is ill-posed; the original task list already specified "relative changes rather
than full parameter fitting." (2) The spot-colatitude convention (0–180° from the spin pole).
(3) J0030's geometry is confirmed non-dipolar (Riley/Miller/Bilous 2019) but otherwise
unexplained — and adopted as a fixed input regardless.**

These consolidate the conventions and citations the paper leans on without changing any
computation: the angle/coordinate conventions and the Bilous 2019 + Riley/Miller geometry
quotes now live in [`docs/references.md`](docs/references.md), and the forward-vs-inverse
reconciliation is written up in the deep dive.

📐 **Full derivation:** [v0.9.3 — Research Notes](docs/deep-dives/v0.9.3-research-notes.md)

**Next:** v1.0.0 — the paper; the geometry phase diagram that turns the J0030/J0740 anchors
into a general tiling / PF-saturation rule is the headline figure in progress.

### v0.9.2 — At a second real star, the systematic lands in the pulsed fraction
*2026-06-24 · commit `474d470`*

**Anchored at PSR J0740+6620 — the non-eclipsing complement of J0030 — the beaming
systematic comes back to life in the pulsed fraction: ΔPF ≈ +0.16 (Riley 2021) to
+0.23 (Miller 2021) at τ ≈ 10. J0740's two hot spots are anti-phased and *tile* the
rotation, so the pulse never reaches zero, PF stays unsaturated, and the swap shows up
where NICER reads it. Both teams agree.**

v0.9.1 showed the systematic *hides* at J0030 because its same-hemisphere spots eclipse
and pin PF at 1. J0740 is the opposite geometry: viewed nearly edge-on (i ≈ 87.6°) but
extremely compact (u ≈ 0.494), so light bending keeps Riley's two spots (colatitudes
77°/108°, opposite hemispheres) visible *all* rotation — they only graze the limb
(μ_min ≈ 0.005), never set. Anti-phased ~half a cycle apart, they tile the cycle: the
two-spot pulse floor is `F_min/F_max ≈ 0.70`, so `PF_iso ≈ 0.18` — low and far from
saturation. The isotropic→realistic swap then raises PF directly, **ΔPF = +0.164 at
τ ≈ 10** (PF: 0.18 → 0.34), the same sign, size, and τ-shape as v0.9.0's invented
geometries — now on a published star, and PF-visible. Miller's independent fit places
the spots on the equator (≈ 92°), where each *center* dips behind for ~21% of the cycle
— yet anti-phasing keeps the combined pulse off zero (floor ≈ 0.63), so PF stays
unsaturated and ΔPF ≈ +0.23. The lesson v0.9.1 hinted at is now precise: what saturates
PF is not single-spot eclipse but whether the spots **tile** the rotation.

### v0.9.1 — At a real star, the systematic hides in the waveform shape
*2026-06-10 · commit `<pending>`*

**Anchored at PSR J0030+0451's published geometry, the beaming systematic almost
vanishes from the pulsed fraction — and that is the point. J0030's spots eclipse, so
PF saturates; the systematic moves into the waveform *shape* (~6–8% RMS). Its
observability is geometry-dependent.**

v0.9.0 found ΔPF up to +0.16 on convenient always-visible geometries. Planting the
*same* swap at J0030 — the canonical NICER target, using both the Riley 2019 (X-PSI)
and Miller 2019 (Illinois–Maryland) fits — both teams place the hot spots in the same
far hemisphere, viewed nearly edge-on. The spots dive behind the star for ~45% of each
rotation, so the flux hits zero and the pulsed fraction pins at 1 for *both* beamings
(ΔPF ≈ 0). This is not a null: it is the extreme of v0.9.0's own "high-contrast" corner
(ΔPF only +0.018 there), where a saturated PF has no headroom. The beaming difference
doesn't disappear — it reshapes the visible waveform by ~6–8% RMS (growing with τ, like
the v0.9.0 effect). So the systematic is **PF-visible at intermediate geometries,
shape-visible at J0030** — geometry decides which measurement can catch it.

### v0.9.0 — Scattering limb darkening sharpens the pulse
*2026-06-10 · commit `530eafc`*

**The first science result: swapping the textbook isotropic spot for our measured
scattering beaming `I(μ; τ)` — at the exact same geometry — raises the pulsed
fraction by up to ~16 percentage points. That is the systematic NICER would
misattribute if it assumed isotropy.**

Earlier work proved the geometry and light bending are correct, both using an
isotropic spot. This comparison holds that verified geometry fixed and changes only
the surface brightness: isotropic (`I ≡ 1`) vs. the realistic `I(μ; τ)` from the
beaming library. Because the surface is brighter face-on than at a graze, the
bright phase (spot facing us) is boosted more than the faint phase (spot at the
limb), so the pulse **sharpens** — `ΔPF = PF_real − PF_iso > 0` for every geometry,
growing with optical depth as the limb-darkening slope steepens (peaking near
τ≈10, easing at τ=30 just as the measured slope `b(τ)` does). The effect is largest
at intermediate geometries (ΔPF ≈ +0.16 at i=45°, θ_s=60°), where beaming has the
most leverage. This is also the real number that replaces the draft's fabricated
"∼15%".

- **The swap:** `compute_profile(i, θ_s, u, beaming=beaming_lookup(mu_centers,
  intensity_by_tau[k]))` vs. the same call with `beaming=None`. Only the brightness
  term differs; a test asserts `cos α` and the visibility mask are bit-for-bit
  identical, so ΔPF is provably the beaming systematic, not a geometry artifact.
- **New helper:** `beaming_lookup` (in `mcrt.beaming`) — a pure, clamped 1-D linear
  interpolation of one τ row of the library; the noisy μ→0 tail is held flat rather
  than extrapolated. The `BeamingFunc` type now lives in `beaming` and is reused by
  `pulse`. No engine-physics change.
- **Result** (u ≈ 0.3445; M = 1.4 M⊙, R = 12 km): at τ=10, ΔPF = +0.065
  (i=20°/θ_s=20°), **+0.163** (45°/60°), +0.018 (60°/60°). Positive throughout,
  monotone-ish in τ with a peak at τ≈10 — it tracks the measured slope `b(τ)`.
- **Sign locked in a test:** the Eddington law (1 + 1.5μ), a monotone stand-in for
  the library, raises PF over isotropic — so the "sharpens" claim does not rest on
  the specific library numbers.
- **Scope:** monochromatic/bolometric, conservative Thomson, slow-rotation

### v0.8.1 — Our waveform matches the NICER code comparison

**The pulse-profile machinery now reproduces a published NICER code-comparison
waveform to ~1% — independent confirmation that our geometry and light bending
agree with the exact ray-tracing codes the field uses, not just with our own
closed form.**

The analytic check tested the pipeline against a formula we derived ourselves; this
step checks it against someone else's *exact* code. We run the existing point-spot model at
the Bogdanov et al. (2019, "Paper II" / L26) **Test SD1a** geometry — a 1 Hz
(effectively non-rotating), isotropic, point-like spot, the one case in their
suite that needs no physics we defer — and compare to the Illinois–Maryland (IM)
reference profile. The match is max |Δ| = 0.8%, RMS 0.2%, with an identical
eclipse width; the only deviation sits at the grazing eclipse edge, which is the
known ~1% error of the Beloborodov bending approximation vs. exact ray-tracing.
No new module code — this is the v0.8.0 machinery evaluated at a community
benchmark.

### v0.8.0 — A spinning hot spot becomes a pulse profile
*2026-06-08 · commit `9dfe74f`*

**The beaming function now drives an actual observable: brightness vs. rotation phase for a hot
spot on a spinning neutron star. The geometry, gravitational light bending, and integration are
verified bug-free against a closed form (the analytic check) before any new physics is allowed to
carry meaning.**

A new deterministic module turns the three ingredients of a pulse profile — viewing geometry,
Beloborodov light bending, and the surface beaming `I(μ)` — into the observed flux `F(φ)` and its
**pulsed fraction**. The verify-then-measure sequence starts here: with an *isotropic* spot the flux reduces
to a closed form, so the numerical pipeline must reproduce it exactly. It does, to machine
precision, for both an always-visible geometry and one where the spot sets behind the star yet is
partly visible "around the back" via bending. The physics shows through cleanly: as compactness `u`
grows, bending first lifts the spot out of eclipse and then **smooths** the pulse (PF 1.00 → 0.78 →
0.60). No Monte Carlo is involved — this layer is pure geometry and relativity on top of the
existing library.

  (`F ∝ (1−u) I(cos α) cos α`), `pulsed_fraction`, and `analytic_isotropic_pf` (the analytic-check
  closed form, which refuses eclipsing geometry).
- **The analytic check:** the numerical profile matches `F ∝ (1−u)(u + (1−u)cos ψ)` and the closed-form PF to
  machine precision (far inside the < 1 % target), verified against an *inline-derived* benchmark
  sharing no code with the module, for two geometries including one with `ψ_max > 90°`.
- **Design seam for the beaming comparison:** `point_spot_flux(..., beaming=I_of_mu)` injects `I(μ)`; the default is
  isotropic. A test locks in that constant beaming reproduces the isotropic flux bit-for-bit, so the
  isotropic-vs-realistic comparison (v0.9.0) is a one-line swap with geometry held identical.
- **Figure** `scripts/pulse_demo.py` → `data/pulse_profile_analytic.png` (deterministic; no seed).

### v0.7.0 — How many photons is enough? The convergence study
*2026-06-03 · commits `612102e`, `1821acb`*

**The by-feel photon counts (5000 / 1000 / 200000) are now backed by an error-vs-N study:
every observable's Monte Carlo noise falls as the textbook 1/√N, and we can read off how
many photons each measurement actually needs.**

To answer the reviewer's natural question — *"why 5000 and not 500?"* — we leaned on the
reproducible seeding from v0.6.2 and swept the photon count across three decades at five
independent seeds each, estimating each observable's error as its spread across seeds. Energy
conservation is exact at any N; the mean free path needs only ~4.5k photons for 0.5%; the
beaming-function bulk shape is good to ~2% by ~2×10⁵. The binding case is the **low-μ tail** of
the beaming function — at 10⁶ photons it still carries ~2.8% noise and would need ~1.5×10⁶
(extrapolated) to reach 2%, the same grazing-angle corner that makes τ = 30 noisy. This is the
project's natural opening for variance reduction.

### v0.6.2 — Reproducible runs: the engine takes an explicit random generator
*2026-06-03 · commits `9d65dd8`, `1f80f25`*

**Every simulation can now be reproduced exactly and seeded independently — the engine accepts
an explicit random generator instead of drawing from global state. This is the quiet piece of
plumbing that makes a real error-vs-N study (v0.7.0) possible.**

A Monte Carlo result is only as trustworthy as its error bar, and you cannot measure that error
bar without repeating a run under independent, controlled randomness. Until now the engine drew
from NumPy's global `np.random`, so two runs could never be made identical and independent seed
streams could not be guaranteed. `Simulation` now takes an optional `rng` (a
`numpy.random.Generator`) threaded through every sampler; the same seed reproduces a run
bit-for-bit, and `SeedSequence.spawn` hands out provably-independent streams for multi-seed
studies. The default path is unchanged, so nothing downstream had to move.

### v0.6.1 — Isotropic-intensity injection fixes the thin-τ beaming
*2026-06-01 · commits `f82a192`, `63bfac0`*

**Switching the source to emit an isotropic *intensity* (one line) removes the unphysical thin-τ
limb brightening — the limb-darkening slope now rises cleanly from near-isotropic to the
Chandrasekhar regime as the atmosphere thickens.**

v0.6.0 traced the thin-τ defect to the boundary source: photons were injected uniformly in μ,
which is isotropic per solid angle but not in specific intensity. A surface of constant brightness
emits *more* photons straight out than grazing — its photon number per μ goes as `N(μ) ∝ μ` — so
the correct sampling is `costheta = sqrt(U)`, not `uniform(0,1)`. With that change the regenerated
library is physically sound across all τ: `b(τ)` rises monotonically from ~0.3 (thin, near
isotropic) through Eddington (`b = 1.5`) near τ ≈ 1 to ~1.7–1.8 (thick), with no negative values.
The thick end is unchanged — τ = 10 still gives `b ≈ 1.79`, matching v0.5.1 — because heavy
scattering erases the injection direction.

  little); τ = 30 dips to 1.67 from low-μ tail noise (~8.5k escapers), to be sized by the

### v0.6.0 — The beaming function as a function of optical depth
*2026-06-01 · commits `3f8e4a5`, `a3da846`*

**We now extract the beaming function across a range of atmosphere thicknesses τ, producing a
reusable `I(μ; τ)` library — and that sweep exposed an unphysical limb-brightening at thin τ that
traces back to how photons are injected.**

Pulse-profile synthesis needs the beaming function not at one optical depth but across a range,
because the amount of limb darkening is set by how much a photon scatters before escaping. The
new sweep tabulates `I(μ)` for τ from 0.1 to 30 and saves it as a lookup table. The thick end
behaves exactly as theory demands — the curves collapse onto the Chandrasekhar H-function and the
slope settles at `b ≈ 1.75`. The thin end does **not**: at τ = 0.1–0.3 the fitted slope goes
negative (the star appears *brighter* at its limb than face-on). The cause is the boundary
source — the engine injects photons uniformly in μ, which is isotropic per *solid angle* but not
isotropic in *intensity* — and at thin τ, where almost nothing scatters, that source shines
straight through. Documented here as a baseline; the fix follows in v0.6.x.

- **Known defect:** thin-τ limb brightening (`b < 0`). At τ = 0.1, ~84% of escapers never
  scatter, so the emergent field is the injected source. Uniform-in-μ injection over-produces
  grazing photons relative to an isotropic-intensity source (which emits `N(μ) ∝ μ`); the
  flux→intensity `÷μ` step then turns flat counts into `I ∝ 1/μ`. Fix tracked for v0.6.1
  (`costheta = sqrt(U)`).
</details>

**Next:** make the source isotropic in intensity (`costheta = sqrt(U)`), regenerate the library,
and confirm `b(τ)` rises cleanly 0 → 1.75 (v0.6.1).

### v0.5.1 — The beaming function matches theory, after fixing flux vs. intensity
*2026-05-28 · commit `f458a20`*

**A reviewer flagged that our beaming curve didn't follow theory. The cause was measuring the
wrong quantity — once corrected, it tracks the classical limb-darkening laws.**

The original code histogrammed escaping photons directly, which measures the emergent *flux* —
not the *specific intensity* that the Eddington and Chandrasekhar laws describe. A photon
escaping at angle θ carries a factor μ = cos θ of normal flux, so dividing the binned counts by
μ recovers the intensity. After the fix, the Monte Carlo curve sits right between the Eddington
`1 + 1.5μ` law and the exact Chandrasekhar H-function, and a photon-count study shows the best
fit settling down as the statistics improve.

📐 **Full derivation:** [v0.5.1 — Beaming Function: Flux vs. Intensity](docs/deep-dives/v0.5.1-beaming-correction.md)

<details>
<summary>Technical details</summary>

- **The fix:** `I(μ) ∝ N(μ)/μ` — divide the binned escape counts by the bin-center μ to convert
  the measured flux into specific intensity.
- **Best fit:** limb-darkening slope `b ≈ 1.7` (Eddington predicts 1.5; the true H-function is
  slightly steeper than the linear law, so `b > 1.5` is expected).
- **Parameter study:** `data/beaming_convergence.png` — the fitted slope is noisy at low photon
  counts and settles toward ~1.7 as N grows from 2k → 200k (a convergence trend, not drift).
- **New code:** `src/mcrt/theory.py` (Chandrasekhar H-function), `src/mcrt/beaming.py`
  (flux→intensity extraction), `scripts/convergence_study.py`.
- **Magnetic effects:** still deferred — to be considered only once the beaming function is fully
  pinned down.
</details>

**Next:** extract beaming functions across a range of τ_total values, then pulse-profile synthesis.

### v0.5.0 — Engine validated: conservation & mean free path
*2026-03-14 · commits `f21738d`–`a3abc18`*

**Two physics-independent bookkeeping checks confirm the random walk is sound: no photons are
lost or created, and they travel the right average distance between scatters.**

We validated the engine two ways that rely on no astrophysics at all. First, every injected
photon ends as either *escaped* or *absorbed* — nothing vanishes or is double-counted. Second,
the mean distance between scatters comes out to one optical depth, exactly as the `−ln(U)`
sampling demands. We also extracted a first beaming function from the escape angles — but
comparing it to theory surfaced a subtle measurement error (binning flux rather than intensity),
which is corrected in v0.5.1 above.

<details>
<summary>Technical details</summary>

- **Energy/photon conservation:** every injected photon ends as either *escaped* or *absorbed*;
  5000/5000 accounted for, exactly.
- **Mean free path:** total path length ÷ total scatters ≈ **1.0** optical depth (measured
  ~1.00–1.03), confirming the `−ln(U)` step sampling is correct.
- First beaming-function extraction revealed a flux-vs-intensity mismatch — resolved in v0.5.1.
- Code: `scripts/validate_engine.py`.
</details>

📐 **Full derivation:** [v0.5.0 — Validation & the Beaming Function](docs/deep-dives/v0.5.0-validation.md)

**Next:** correct the beaming-function measurement and compare to analytic limb-darkening laws (v0.5.1).

### v0.2.0 — Photons travel through the atmosphere end-to-end
*2026-03-14 · commit `f21738d`*

**A photon can now be injected at the base of the atmosphere, scatter its way through, and
either escape or be reabsorbed — the complete random walk.**

This is the core of the project. Photons start at the bottom moving in random upward
directions, take exponentially-distributed steps, and at each stop scatter off an electron via
Thomson scattering (which slightly prefers forward/backward over sideways). When a photon
reaches the top it escapes and we record its exit angle; if it drifts back down to the surface
it is absorbed. Everything is measured in *optical depth* rather than meters, which keeps the
physics general.

📐 **Full derivation:** [v0.2.0 — Photon Transport](docs/deep-dives/v0.2.0-photon-transport.md)

<details>
<summary>Technical details</summary>

- **Geometry:** 3D Cartesian in optical-depth coordinates; τ = 0 is the top (escape), τ =
  τ_total is the bottom (injection). Plane-parallel slab.
- **Injection:** isotropic over the upward hemisphere (uniform in cos θ, not in θ — see the
  [v0.2.0 deep dive](docs/deep-dives/v0.2.0-photon-transport.md)).
- **Transport:** step size `Δτ = −ln(U)` (exponential free path); Thomson phase function
  `(3/4)(1 + μ²)` via rejection sampling; 3D direction update via `rotate_vector`.
- **Boundaries:** escape at τ ≤ 0 (record exit μ), absorb at τ ≥ τ_total.
- Code: `src/mcrt/monte_carlo.py` (`Photon`, `Simulation`).
</details>

**Next:** validate the random walk against analytic limits (v0.5.0).

### v0.1.0 — The building blocks are in place and tested
*2026-01-24 → 2026-03-14 · commits `ab83703`, `f50cd2a`*

**Every random-sampling primitive the simulation depends on is written and unit-tested.**

Before tracking a single photon we needed the small mathematical tools that the random walk is
built from: how far a photon travels before it scatters, which direction it scatters into, and
how to point it correctly in 3D afterward. Each of these is a short, independently-tested
function, so when the full engine was assembled in v0.2.0 we already trusted its parts.

- `sample_step_size()` — exponential free path via `−ln(U)`.
- `sample_thomson_angle()` — Thomson `(3/4)(1 + μ²)` by rejection sampling.
- `get_random_direction()`, `rotate_vector()` — isotropic directions and scatter rotation.
- pytest suite in `tests/test_physics.py` checks the exponential mean (≈ 1.0), angle bounds,
  and unit-norm preservation under repeated scatters.
- Code: `src/mcrt/utils.py`.

## Reference

### Physics model

A plane-parallel atmospheric slab in optical-depth coordinates:

```
τ = 0        ← TOP (escape surface)
   ↑
   │  photon scatters, propagates
   │
τ = τ_total  ← BOTTOM (injection point)
```

### Design decisions

| Choice | Decision | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Scattering** | Thomson | Correct phase function P(μ) ∝ (1 + μ²) for electron-dominated atmospheres |
| **Bottom boundary** | Absorb | Standard approach — photons returning downward are "lost to the thermal source" |
| **Energy** | Monochromatic | Isolates the angular redistribution effect; avoids Compton/Klein-Nishina complexity |
| **Polarization** | Not tracked | Second-order effect with high implementation cost |

### What we defer (future work)

| Feature | Why deferred | Impact |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Compton scattering** | Requires Klein-Nishina cross-section; energy-dependent opacity | Would allow spectral analysis |
| **Polarization** | Requires Stokes vector tracking; Mueller matrix algebra | Would enable polarimetric predictions |
| **Magnetic effects** | O-mode/X-mode splitting in strong B-fields | Relevant for magnetars |
| **Curved geometry** | Full spherical atmosphere instead of plane-parallel slab | Needed for very extended atmospheres |

These are noted as limitations in the paper and provide clear directions for follow-up studies.

### Timeline

*The 10-week plan, with the version each milestone shipped as:*

- [x] **Weeks 1-2 — v0.1.0**: Physics setup & sampling primitives
- [x] **Weeks 3-4 — v0.2.0**: Monte Carlo engine (photon transport, boundary handling)
- [x] **Week 5 — v0.5.0**: Validation & benchmarking (energy conservation, mean free path)
- [x] **Patch — v0.5.1**: Beaming function corrected (flux→intensity), validated vs. Eddington / Chandrasekhar H
- [x] **Weeks 6-7 — v0.6.0 / v0.6.1**: Beaming function extracted across τ_total values into a library; thin-τ injection defect found (v0.6.0) and fixed via isotropic-intensity injection (v0.6.1)
- [x] **Patch — v0.6.2**: Reproducible seeding — explicit `numpy.random.Generator` threaded through the engine; the prerequisite for measurable error bars
- [x] **Patch — v0.7.0**: Convergence study (error vs N) — defensible photon counts replace the by-feel values; vectorization assessed and deferred
- [x] **Weeks 8-9 — v0.8.0**: Pulse-profile machinery + the analytic check (point spot, Beloborodov bending, verified vs. closed form to machine precision)
- [x] **Week 9 — v0.8.1**: Code-comparison check — reproduced the Bogdanov L26 SD1a waveform (matched the IM reference to ~1%, limited by the Beloborodov approximation)
- [x] **v0.9.0**: Isotropic-vs-realistic ΔPF at fixed geometry; limb darkening sharpens the pulse, ΔPF up to ~+0.16 (the real number replacing the draft's fabricated "∼15%")
- [x] **v0.9.1**: Real-star anchor at PSR J0030+0451 (Riley 2019 / Miller 2019) — its spots eclipse, so the pulsed fraction saturates and the beaming systematic moves into the waveform shape (~6–8% RMS); the systematic's observability is geometry-dependent
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Analysis & paper completion

## How to update the progress log

Each version produces **two** linked pieces: a short entry at the **top** of the Progress Log,
and a companion **deep dive** in [`docs/deep-dives/`](docs/deep-dives/) holding the full math.
Bump the version in `pyproject.toml`, name the deep dive `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-<slug>.md`, and keep
the entry headline plain-physics (no code jargon); put code in `<details>` and the derivations in
the deep dive.

```markdown
### vX.Y.Z — <plain-physics headline read in 30 seconds>
*<date>* · commits `abcd123`–`efgh456`

**<One bold sentence: what now works and why it matters for the science.>**

<2–4 sentences of physics context — what was added, what we can now do that we couldn't.>

For the companion deep dive, copy an existing file in `docs/deep-dives/` as a template: open
with a link back to its progress-log entry, a **Builds on:** line pointing to the prior deep
dive, the derivation with figures (regenerate via `make_figures.py`), and a closing **Next:**.

Workflow: when a version's work is committed, both pieces are drafted from that version's commits
and figures, then the physics framing is reviewed before they land.
